# VPS Setup
This repository is a knowledge and scripts base for setting up VPS server from the beggining.

I'm using mikr.us servers for hobby projects as cost effective learning vps platform



## Usual steps for preparing VPS server
1. Install docker (using `noobs/scripts/chce_dockera.sh`)
2. Check if docker is working (using `docker run hello-world`)
3. Install `fnm` for installing node versions. https://github.com/Schniz/fnm?tab=readme-ov-file#using-a-script-macoslinux
4. Install newest node version
5. Install `pnpm` using script from https://pnpm.io/installation#using-npm
